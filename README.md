# MentalHealthForumAnalysis

## Project Description

This repository explores mental health risks by analyzing user-generated content from Reddit and Beyond Blue forums using large language models (LLMs) and network analysis. The project aims to detect, classify, and measure emotional expressions, flag high-risk posts, and track trends to support early detection and awareness.

## Objectives

- Detect and classify forum posts containing mental health-related content using LLMs and machine learning.
- Identify emotion subtypes (such as grief, hopelessness, guilt) and assign severity scores.
- Flag high-risk content with rule-based alerts.
- Track emotional trends over time and visualize symptom co-occurrence through network graphs.
- Compare emotional expression, risk indicators, and discussion patterns between global (Reddit) and Australian (Beyond Blue) forums.

## Methods

- Data collection via web scraping and keyword filtering from Reddit and Beyond Blue.
- Preprocessing: text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
- Model development: fine-tuning transformer models (RoBERTa, BERT) and testing classical ML baselines as needed.
- Emotion subtype and severity detection, crisis flagging, and temporal analysis.
- Network analysis for symptom clustering and emotional trajectories.
